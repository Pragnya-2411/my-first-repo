# my-first-repo
Hi! This is my first ever repository on GitHub. I'm just starting my coding journey, and this is my playground. What's in this repo? Right now, not much But I’ll be adding cool stuff as I learn! I'm learning how to code, use GitHub, and become a dev ninja. Stick around — cool things are coming! Thanks for Visiting! Peace out! ✌️
